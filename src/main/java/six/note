1. Functional Interface?

A Functional Interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method.
It is mainly used to enable lambda expressions and method references (introduced in Java 8).

2. @FunctionalInterface Annotation?
@FunctionalInterface Annotation
It is optional, but recommended.
It ensures compile-time checking that the interface has only one abstract method.

3. Why Functional Interfaces Are Important?
Supports lambda expressions
Makes code shorter, cleaner, and readable
Widely used in Streams API, Collections, and Multithreading

4. Lambda Expression?
A lambda expression is a short block of code that used to implement a functional interface in a concise way.
Syntax:
(parameters) -> { body }

5. Why Lambda Expressions Are Used?
Reduce boilerplate code
Improve readability
Support functional programming
Widely used in Streams API
Useful in multithreading
